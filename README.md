This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

<!-- install nodemodules -->
npm install  

<!-- run the project -->
npm run dev


Here, i created a full stack web application using next js.

<!-- UI -->
I had separated the code with pages and components.
I had used antdChart for data visualization.
I had used RTK Query for api integration and Global state management.

<!-- API -->
you can find the ui with the api in this application. For api, you can find  under the pages file like pages -> api . Here i am inserted a dummy values.
